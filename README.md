### Which city should we move to after LBS?

A simple answer to this question would be "Whereever I can get a job!". But since we are *data analysts*, in this project, we have used R to analyze 12 cities—London, Berlin, Copenhagen, Dubai, Mumbai, San Francisco, New York, Singapore, Shanghai, Paris, Sydney, and Tokyo—to make a data-driven decision on what the best city would be to move to post-university. We focused on 7 critical aspects: employment, safety, work-life balance, cost of living, sustainability, weather, and transport. 

For each aspect, we developed charts and a leaderboard ranking the cities based on specific criteria, facilitating easy comparison. A weighted average calculation was employed to determine the overall best city, considering individual preferences through assigned weights to different aspects.

We delved into employment opportunities, safety statistics, work-life balance factors, cost of living considerations, sustainability initiatives, weather conditions, and the efficiency of public transportation. The GitHub repository contains R code, detailed documentation on methodology and data sources, enabling users to replicate results and modify the code for their needs.

This project serves as a valuable resource for those making informed decisions about post-university life. It provides a transparent and reproducible reference for understanding the analysis process. Feel free to reach out for additional information or collaboration opportunities.

Happy exploring, and best of luck with your job search in the city of your dreams!
